# Dog Door Simulator 🐶🚪

This is a simple Java simulation of an automated dog door system.

### 📂 Files Included
- `DogDoor.java` — Core logic for opening and closing the dog door.
- `Bark.java` — Represents a dog's bark.
- Remote.java -Represents the remote control system.
- `BarkRecognizer.java` — Recognizes if a bark matches an allowed one.
- `DogDoorSimulator.java` — Main class that simulates how the dog door system works.

### 🚀 How it Works
1. The user simulates a remote button press to open the door.
2. The door automatically closes after a short delay.
3. A `BarkRecognizer` ensures only allowed dogs can trigger the door using their bark.

### ✅ Example Use Case
Simulates a situation where a dog named Fido is allowed through the door, while other barking dogs are not.

### 📌 Concepts Used
- Object-Oriented Design
- Java Classes and Composition
- Simple Simulation of Smart Device Behavior
